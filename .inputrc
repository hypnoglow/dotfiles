# /etc/inputrc - global inputrc for libreadline
# See readline(3readline) and `info rluserman' for more information.
#
# Note: inputrc is for bash. For example, zsh has its own line editor (ZLE) and doesn't read readline's inputrc.
# Also, see /usr/share/doc/bash/inputrc.arrows for other codes of arrow keys.

# If set to ‘on’, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.
# It’s only active when performing completion in the middle of a word.
# If enabled, readline does not insert characters from the completion that match characters
# after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
# For instance, if this is enabled, attempting completion when the cursor is after the ‘e’ in ‘Makefile’
# will result in ‘Makefile’ rather than ‘Makefilefile’, assuming there is a single possible completion.
