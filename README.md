# .files

These are mine dotfiles. \o/ :metal:

If you barely understand what it is, or if you want an in-depth tutorial about organizing your dotfiles,
see [this post](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.j9vtwid73) as an example.

This targets ArchLinux/Manjaro systems, but almost all things are compatible with other Linux system or at least
easy adaptable to it. Feel free to take anything from this.

## Installation

Installation is done via [dotbro](https://github.com/hypnoglow/dotbro).  
See that repository for an easy way to install dotfiles.
